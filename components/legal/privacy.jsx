					Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track

					your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
					follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
					Notice.
				</p>

				<p className={styles.chapterText}>
					California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there
